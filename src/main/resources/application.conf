    # The max time period that a client connection will be waiting for a response
    # before triggering a request timeout. The timer for this logic is not started
    # until the connection is actually in a state to receive the response, which
    # may be quite some time after the request has been received from the
    # application!
    # There are two main reasons to delay the start of the request timeout timer:
    # 1. On the host-level API with pipelining disabled:
    #    If the request cannot be sent immediately because all connections are
    #    currently busy with earlier requests it has to be queued until a
    #    connection becomes available.
    # 2. With pipelining enabled:
    #    The request timeout timer starts only once the response for the
    #    preceding request on the connection has arrived.
    # Set to `infinite` to completely disable request timeouts.
    request-timeout = infinite

    # If this setting is non-zero the HTTP client connections automatically
    # aggregate incoming response chunks into full HttpResponses before
    # dispatching them to the application.
    # If the size of the aggregated response surpasses the specified limit the
    # HTTP client connection is closed and an error returned.
    # Set to zero to disable automatic request chunk aggregation and have
    # ChunkedResponseStart, MessageChunk and ChunkedMessageEnd messages be
    # dispatched to the application.
    response-chunk-aggregation-limit = 0
